	<p>Paradise is closer than you think. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas, better known simply as the Bahamas, is a chain of islands spread out over 500 miles in the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical and laid-back, these Caribbean islands are a favorite for vacationers because they're easy to reach yet provide an experience far removed from the ordinary, thanks to turquoise waters, warm, salty breezes, and plenty of opportunities to learn how to enjoy life to the fullest from the locals. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>One of the most popular things to do in the Bahamas is visit the Atlantis, a resort located on Paradise Island in Nassau. Many flights stop in Nassau, and there's a lot to do whether or not you stay on the property, making it a convenient destination. Plus, you don't have to be a guest to purchase a day pass to the thrilling 141-acre Aquaventure water park. There's also a casino, golf course, and multiple restaurants to enjoy. </p>

<p>Other draws in Nassau are the Versailles Gardens, Bahama Barrels winery, tours of John Watling's Distillery, and learning to make your own chocolates at Graycliff Chocolatier.</p>
	<p>Lucayan National Park on Grand Bahama Island is another favorite, though most people only visit this island if they're stopping here on a cruise. You can kayak through mangroves or simply stroll around. If you're in Nassau, Clifton Heritage National Park is great spot to snorkel because there are underwater statues.
