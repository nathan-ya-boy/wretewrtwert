			<li><a href="https://thepoopdeck.com/">The Poop Deck</a></li>
		<p>Ok, so that doesn’t really sound appetizing, but believe us when we say that Poop Deck offers some of the best food in the Bahamas.

Located along East Bay Street and another branch in Sandyport, this breezy eatery is where you’ll get some of the freshest seafood served from sea to table. <br>
</p>A bit outdated, some might say, but people come here not for a luxe dining experience but for their good food and service.

<p>The Poop Deck offers a nice, relaxing environment where you can eat while enjoying the beautiful view by the water.

What to Eat
The Coconut Shrimp at The Poop Deck is a must-try for shrimp lovers.

We also recommend trying the Conch Fritters and the Snapper.</p>
		<li><a href="https://www.fishfrynassau.com/">The Fish Fry</a></li>
		<p>In Nassau, Bahamas is a congregation of street vendors or beach shacks offering the most authentic cuisine on the island. Think of it as the ultimate seafood festival, somewhat likened to a Bahamian backyard experience. <br> </p>

<p>If you’re searching for native dishes on the run, a stop at The Fish Fry is what you need.

This is one of the best places to eat in the Bahamas if you’re looking for authentic, unpretentious local restaurants offering the best flavors and tastes on the island.

From Oh Andrews to Twin Brothers, this strip is good for getting some fresh and delicious Grouper, Snapper, and some Conch Salad.</p>
		<li><a href="https://noburestaurants.com/">Nobu</a></li>
<p>Located along One Casino Drive in Bahamas, Nobu is the place to go for Japanese Cuisine with a Bohemian twist.

As one of the best rated restaurants in the Bahamas, this restaurant is the frontier of the acclaimed master chef Nobu Matsuhisa.</p>

If you’re looking for a place to splurge or impress a date with delicious Japanese fusion food, then this is where you should go.

What happens when you try Nobu’s Black Cod bathed in a miso marinade for three days?

<p>Complete satisfaction, we tell you.

Other dishes we recommend at Nobu are the delicious A5 Wagyu Dumplings and the amazing Lobster Sushi.
